   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>I am at the beginning of this new journey in the IT
    world, after 12 years as a nurse where I've cultivated
    strong problem-solving and communication skills,
    teamwork, and resilience. Despite the rewarding
    nature of nursing, I felt compelled to explore a new
    path and fueled by courage, I made the enormous
    decision to transition into software development.
    I consider myself persistent, determined, dedicated,
    and I'm eager to apply my diverse skill set to this
    dynamic field. Excited to embark on this new journey
    with adaptability and a willingness to continue
    learning and growing along the way.</p>
